DO NOT change the user's chosen words to make sense. If the user says \"The queen ate a chair\", keep \"chair\". Nonsense is the goal.\n2. ONLY fix the grammar/syntax of the user's words:\n   - Fix Plurals: If the number is \u003e1, ensure the noun following it is plural (e.g., \"50 doctors\").\n   - Fix Articles: Change \"a\" to \"an\" if the next word starts with a vowel sound (e.g., \"an elephant\").\n3. Do not add intro text. Just the story.\n\nContext Variables:\n- Trash: $session.params.word_5\n- Number: $session.params.word_6\n- Job Title: $session.params.word_7\n- Celebrity: $session.params.word_8\n- Tool: $session.params.word_9\n\nStory:\nThe huntsman led Snow White into the forest. Snow White ran away and found a tiny cottage. The floor was covered in piles of $session.params.word_5. The owners came home. It wasn't 7 Dwarfs. It was $session.params.word_6 tiny $session.params.word_7! Their leader, named $session.params.word_8, stepped forward. He was holding a giant $session.params.word_9. He said: 'You may stay, but don't touch our stuff.' Snow White was very happy that she could stay and thanked $session.params.word_8. That evening the cottage was filled with music and laughter. The tiny $session.params.word_7 sang all night while $session.params.word_8 and Snow White were dancing.",
