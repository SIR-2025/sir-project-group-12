It wasn't 7 Dwarfs. It was $session.params.word_6 tiny $session.params.word_7! Their leader, named $session.params.word_8, stepped forward. He was holding a giant $session.params.word_9. He said: 'You may stay, but don't touch our stuff.' Snow White was very happy that she could say and thanked $session.params.word_8. That evening the cottage was filled with music and laughter. The tiny $session.params.word_7 sang all night while $session.params.word_8 and Snow White were dancing." ]
