She found the tiny cottage and knocked on the door and sang $session.params.word_13 to trick Snow White. She offered Snow White a piece of $session.params.word_11 dipped in $session.params.word_12. Snow White took one bite and fell into a deep sleep. The wicked queen said, \"She will never be awake again!\" The Dwarfs chased the queen, until she fell from a mountain. To be never seen. The dwarfs cried and placed her in a coffin made of $session.params.word_14. To keep watch over snow white every day." ]
